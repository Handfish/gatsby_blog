He had stopped\nriding it as he had settled in to focus on his career as a Lineman, and had posted the machine for an extremely modest price. I was thrilled to hear\nand bought it immediately without any hesitation. The DR650 is the world\'s most badass bike - a dual-sport motorcycle with a counterbalanced, single cylinder, air/oil-cooled engine that outputs 46 horsepower from the factory.\nThe bike is 324 lbs dry, highway capable, a dirt ripper, and has incredible aftermarket.
